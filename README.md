# Fortunoff_ASpace_Aviary_Updating
A batch of SQL queries to facilitate creation and linking of archival objects and digital objects between ArchivesSpace and Aviary.

The Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies uses ArchivesSpace as our content management system, which includes the storage of  top level description and metadata about individual testimonies, related audiovisual materials, and their time-synchronized indexes and transcripts. These are stored in what is called a resource record. The top level description of testimonies, indexes, and transcripts are ingested to populate our access system, Aviary. 

Indexes are synchronized from legacy summarized notes in the Oral History Metadata Synchronizer (OHMS) and transcripts are created using the 3play transcription service. Since these are both created as digital files, they must be added to ArchivesSpace as digital objects and then linked to their matching archival objects within the testimony's resource record. The updates are made using scripts created by fellow Yale archivist Alicia Detelich (https://github.com/ucancallmealicia), using information created from SQL queries.
